            The PREP Platform is a project started by the Partnership for
            Resilience and Preparedness (PREP), a public-private collaboration
            that emerged out of the White House Climate Data Initiative. We aim
            to facilitate collaboration among technology innovators,
            researchers, data scientists, and practitioners from the private
            sector, civil society and government. This cooperation will help
            spur new types of data discovery; develop innovative, customizable
            tools in response to user needs; and facilitate sharing and
            collective learning.

            Our mission is to empower a data-driven approach to building climate
            resilience by providing planners and interested public around the
            globe with accessible, actionable data and insights.

          <Title type="content">The challenge</Title>
          <p>
            Our changing climate is accelerating the intensity and frequency of
            stresses facing communities across the globe. There is now a growing
            recognition that even with aggressive reductions in greenhouse gas
            emissions, continued changes in Earth’s climate are inevitable.
            Society is increasingly focused on preparing for this climate
            variability and change. In 2015, more than 190 nations committed to
            take action to build climate resilience through the Sendai Framework
            for Disaster Risk Reduction, the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable
            Development Goals.
          </p>
          <p>
            But to act on these commitments, planners, businesses, investors,
            and resource managers must have access to robust and actionable
            information, as well as guidance on how to use it to manage the
            risks. Two fundamental problems constrain progress in this area:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Data and information isn’t accessible or usable because it’s held
              in silos across government agencies, the private sector and civil
              society; and
            </li>
            <li>
              Because of these silos, it’s not easy to share information or
              learn from others who are building climate resilience.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The Partnership for Resilience and Preparedness (PREP) aims to
            tackle these related challenges.

          <p>
            The initial product of the Partnership for Resilience and
            Preparedness is a platform to help planners, investors and resource
            managers assess and incorporate climate risks into their decisions
            by enhancing access to the best available data and insights on
            climate variability and change. It leverages innovations in
            information and communication technologies to help users easily
            produce interactive climate risk assessments and resilience plans.
          </p>
          <p>We will do this by:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Focusing on the user. We will continuously pursue input from user
              communities on how the platform can facilitate the use of climate
              risk information in management decisions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Enabling the next generation of living climate reports and
              resilience  plans that provide interactive access to the
              underlying scientific data.
            </li>
            <li>
              Developing an open platform that enables access to climate-related
              information from across government agencies and other relevant
              data sets.
            </li>
            <li>
              Enabling users to customize risk dashboards – to create, curate,
              and share content for their users and embedding the functionality
              into their websites.
            </li>
            <li>
              Accelerating the migration of USG and other climate-relevant
              datasets into the Cloud for 3rd party applications to use.
